<b>What is Kindle FreeTime?</b>~~Kindle FreeTime is a new experience built from the ground up just for kids, available only on Kindle Fire and now on Kindle Paperwhite. Kindle FreeTime allows you to choose books youʼve purchased to create a personalised experience for each of your children, giving you complete control over what books each child can access. On Kindle Paperwhite, children can read books in a simple, fun, and safe environment designed specifically for them.~~~~<b>How does Kindle FreeTime work?</b>~~Kindle FreeTime gives you peace of mind that your child wonʼt access inappropriate content or websites or accidentally purchase books from the Kindle Store, while providing a fun and easy-to-use interface for kids. Kindle FreeTime:~~~~• Blocks access to browsing and purchasing in the Kindle Store;~~• Blocks access to the experimental web browser;~~• Blocks access to Wikipedia;~~• Disables social sharing.~~~~<b>Books in Kindle FreeTime:</b>~~You can choose specific books for your child in Kindle FreeTime from your library or when you purchase new books from Amazon. You can select whatever books you feel appropriate, and change your selections at any time. Books that you share in Kindle FreeTime will function just like they would do normally on your Kindle Paperwhite, except that the protections listed above will limit some functionality. Books you share in Kindle FreeTime will be available in your childʼs profile on both Kindle Fire and Kindle Paperwhite devices.~~~~<b>What information do you share with Amazon in Kindle FreeTime?</b>~~In setting up your childʼs profile, we ask you to provide the childʼs screen name (which can be any word you choose), gender and birthdate. In Kindle FreeTime we use your childʼs profile to provide a customised experience, and we do not collect personally identifiable information from your child. Kindle FreeTime provides us information about your childʼs reading activity, which is used to provide you with progress reports on your childʼs reading accomplishments, to enable your child to earn Achievements for meeting specific reading milestones you set, and to improve the Kindle FreeTime experience.
